# Advanced SMS Spam Detection Using NLP

## Project Overview
Welcome to the Advanced SMS Spam Detection repository! This project utilizes the power of Natural Language Processing (NLP) to distinguish between unsolicited 'spam' messages and 'ham' (non-spam) texts. Immerse yourself in a detailed analysis employing the latest in machine learning and deep learning techniques, including Word2Vec, GloVe, and TF-IDF, to develop a highly accurate spam detection filter.

## Dataset Description
The dataset is a comprehensive compilation of text messages that have been accurately categorized, providing a realistic depiction of everyday SMS communication and the inherent challenges in automated spam detection within messaging applications.
## Methodology
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** In-depth analysis of the dataset, understanding the distribution and nature of the text data.
- **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaning and preparing the text data for modeling, including tokenization, stop-word removal, and stemming.
- **Vectorization Techniques:**
  - Word2Vec: Generates embeddings capturing semantic relationships.
  - GloVe: Utilizes global word co-occurrence to provide word embeddings.
  - TF-IDF: Reflects the importance of terms relative to the document corpus.
- **Model Evaluation:** A variety of models were trained and evaluated to determine the most effective approach for spam detection.

## Models Used
- Decision Trees
- Logistic Regression
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Na√Øve Bayes
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Random Forest
- Long Short-Term Memory Networks (LSTM)
- Bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM)
- Gated Recurrent Units (GRU)
- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)

## Innovative Approach
- **in-depth Data Exploration:** Engage in EDA to uncover underlying patterns and trends within SMS data.
- **Comprehensive Data Preprocessing:** Implement extensive text processing with advanced tokenization, stop-word filtering, and normalization methods.
- **Advanced Vectorization Techniques:**
  - **Word2Vec:** Uncover context-dependent word relationships via neural word embeddings.
  - **GloVe:** Investigate word associations with complex co-occurrence matrices.
  - **TF-IDF:** Enhance term significance with this quantitative vectorization technique.
- **Comprehensive Model Evaluation:** Execute a series of training and testing procedures on a diverse range of models to pinpoint the definitive spam detection strategy.
## Project Highlights
Our research highlight the BiLSTM with TF-IDF, CNN with TF-IDF, and Random Forest with Word2Vec as the models of choice. These approaches were meticulously curated for their outstanding predictive capabilities, evidenced by exceptional precision, recall, and F1 scores, guaranteeing the highest level of classification accuracy.
