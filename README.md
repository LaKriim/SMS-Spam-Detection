# Advanced SMS Spam Detection Using NLP

## Project Overview
Welcome to the Advanced SMS Spam Detection repository! This project harnesses the power of NLP to discern unsolicited 'spam' messages from 'ham' (non-spam) communications. Dive into a robust analysis using cutting-edge machine learning and deep learning techniques such as Word2Vec, GloVe, and TF-IDF to build a spam filter with impressive accuracy.

## Dataset Description
Utilizing a meticulously labeled collection of text messages, this project provides a comprehensive framework for SMS spam detection. The dataset is a realistic cross-section of daily SMS traffic representing the challenges of automated spam filtering in communication apps.

## Methodology
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** In-depth analysis of the dataset, understanding the distribution and nature of the text data.
- **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaning and preparing the text data for modeling, including tokenization, stop-word removal, and stemming.
- **Vectorization Techniques:**
  - Word2Vec: Generates embeddings capturing semantic relationships.
  - GloVe: Utilizes global word co-occurrence to provide word embeddings.
  - TF-IDF: Reflects the importance of terms relative to the document corpus.
- **Model Evaluation:** A variety of models were trained and evaluated to determine the most effective approach for spam detection.
